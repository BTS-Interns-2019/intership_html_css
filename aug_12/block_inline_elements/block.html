    <h1>Block Elements</h1>
    <h2>address</h2>
    <p>Indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>article</h2>
    <p>Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be 
        independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine 
        or newspaper article, or a blog entry.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>aside</h2>
    <p>Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. 
        Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>audio</h2>
    <p>Is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the 
        src attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the 
        destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>blockquote</h2>
    <p>Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. 
        A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute,
         while a text representation of the source can be given using the <strong>cite</strong> element.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>details</h2>
    <p>creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an 
        "open" state. A summary or label can be provided using the <strong>summary</strong> element.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>dialog</h2>
    <p>Represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as an inspector or window.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>dd</h2>
    <p>Provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (dt) in a description list (dl).</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>div</h2>
    <p>Is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>dl</h2>
    <p>Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the dt element) 
        and descriptions (provided by dd elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary 
            or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>dt</h2>
    <p>Specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a dl element. It is usually 
        followed by a dd element; however, multiple dt elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by 
            the immediate next dd element.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>fieldset</h2>
    <p>Is used to group several controls as well as labels (label) within a web form.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>figure</h2>

        element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>footer</h2>
    <p>Represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains 
        information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>Represents a document section that contains interactive controls for submitting information to a web server.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>heading h1-h6</h2>
    <p>Represent six levels of section headings. h1 is the highest section level and h6 is the lowest.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>header</h2>
    <p>Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading 
        elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>hgroup</h2>
    <p>Represents a multi-level heading for a section of a document. It groups a set of h1–h6 elements.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>hr</h2>
    <p>Represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift 
        of topic within a section.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>li</h2>
    <p>Is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (ol), an unordered 
        list (ul), or a menu (menu). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points.

    <hr>
    <h2>main</h2>
    <p>Represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly 
        related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>nav</h2>
    <p>Represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to 
        other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>ol</h2>
    <p>Represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered list.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>p</h2>
    <p>Represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent 
        blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, 
        such as images or form fields.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>pre</h2>
    <p>Represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered 
        using a non-proportional ("monospace") font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>section</h2>

        HTML document. Typically, but not always, sections have a heading.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>table</h2>

        HTML document. Typically, but not always, sections have a heading.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>ul</h2>
