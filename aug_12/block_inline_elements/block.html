    <h1>Block Elements</h1>
    <h2>address</h2>
    <p>Indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>article</h2>
    <p>Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be 
        independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine 
        or newspaper article, or a blog entry.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>aside</h2>
    <p>Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. 
        Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>audio</h2>
    <p>Is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the 
        src attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the 
        destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>blockquote</h2>
    <p>Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. 
        A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute,
         while a text representation of the source can be given using the <strong>cite</strong> element.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>details</h2>
    <p>creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an 
        "open" state. A summary or label can be provided using the <strong>summary</strong> element.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>dialog</h2>
    <p>Represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as an inspector or window.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>dd</h2>
    <p>Provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (dt) in a description list (dl).</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>div</h2>
    <p>Is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>dl</h2>
    <p>Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the dt element) 
        and descriptions (provided by dd elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary 
            or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>dt</h2>
    <p>Specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a dl element. It is usually 
        followed by a dd element; however, multiple dt elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by 
            the immediate next dd element.</p>
