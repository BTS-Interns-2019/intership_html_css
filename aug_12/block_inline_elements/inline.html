        <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>
        elements and one <strong>img</strong> element to provide versions of an image for different display/device
        scenarios. The browser
        will consider each child
        <strong>source</strong>
        element and choose the best match among them; if no matches are found, the URL of the <strong>img</strong>
        element's
        src attribute
        is selected. The selected image is then presented in the space occupied by the <strong>img</strong> element.
    </p>

        displayed as a progress bar.</p>

        element to represent
        things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate.</p>
    <h2>&lt;samp&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>samp element</strong> is used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a
        computer program.</p>

    <h2>&lt;slot&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>slot element</strong> is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup,
        which
        lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together.</p>

        represent
        anything.</p>
    <h2>&lt;strong&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>strong element</strong> indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.
        Browsers
        typically render the contents in bold type.</p>
    <h2>&lt;sup&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>Subscript element</strong> specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely
        typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.</p>
    <h2>&lt;template&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>Content template (template) element</strong> is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered
        immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>&lt;textarea&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>textarea element</strong> represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to
        allow
        users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.</p>
    <h2>&lt;time&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>time element</strong> represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to
        translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such
        as
        reminders.</p>
    <h2>&lt;u&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>str element</strong> represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates
        that
        it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered
        using
        CSS.</p>
    <h2>&lt;var&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>Variable element (var)</strong> represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a
        programming context.</p>

        appropriate user
        experience.
    </p>
    <h2>&lt;wbr&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>wbr element</strong> represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may
        optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.</p>
