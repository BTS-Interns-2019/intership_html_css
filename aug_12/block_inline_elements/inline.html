    <h1>Inline Elements</h1>
    <h2>a</h2>
    <p>Along with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, 
        email addresses, or any other URL.
        </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>abbr</h2>
    <p>Represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional title attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation. 
        If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>b</h2>
    <p>Is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. 
        This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should 
        not use b for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the strong 
            element to indicate that text is of special importance.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>bdo</h2>
    <p>Overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>big</h2>
    <p>Renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (medium becomes large, for example). 
        The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>br</h2>
    <p>Produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of 
        lines is significant.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>button</h2>
    <p>Represents a clickable button, which can be used in forms or anywhere in a document that needs simple, standard button 
        functionality. By default, HTML buttons are typically presented in a style similar to that of the host platform the user 
        agent is running on, but you can change buttons’ appearance with CSS.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>cite</h2>
    <p>It´s used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include the title of that work. The reference may be in 
        an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>code</h2>
    <p>Displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, 
        the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>dfn</h2>
    <p>Is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The p element, the dt/dd
        pairing, or the section element which is the nearest ancestor of the dfn is considered to be the definition of the term.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>em</h2>
    <p>Marks text that has stress emphasis. This element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>i</h2>
    <p>Represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason. Some examples include technical terms, foreign language phrases, 
        or fictional character thoughts. It is typically displayed in italic type.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>img</h2>
    <p>Embeds an image into the document. It is a replaced element.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>input</h2>
    <p>It´s used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control 
        widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>kbd</h2>
    <p>Represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user 
        agent defaults to rendering the contents of a kbd element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>label</h2>
    <p>Represents a caption for an item in a user interface.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>object</h2>
    <p>Represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>q</h2>
    <p>Indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. 
        This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the blockquote element.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>samp</h2>
    <p>It´s used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>script</h2>
    <p>It´s used to embed or reference executable code; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>select</h2>
    <p>Represents a control that provides a menu of options:</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>small</h2>
    <p>Represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>span</h2>
    <p>It´s a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for 
        styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when 
        no other semantic element is appropriate.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>strong</h2>
    <p>Indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>sub</h2>
    <p>Specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with 
        a lowered baseline using smaller text.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>sup</h2>
    <p>Specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with 
        a raised baseline using smaller text.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>textarea</h2>
    <p>Represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, 
        for example a comment on a review or feedback form.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>time</h2>
    <p>Represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing 
        for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>var</h2>
    <p>Represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized 
        version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.</p>
