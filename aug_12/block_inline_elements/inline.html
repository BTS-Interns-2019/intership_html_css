        scenarios. The browser
        will consider each child
        <strong>source</strong>
        element and choose the best match among them; if no matches are found, the URL of the <strong>img</strong>
        element's
        src attribute

    <h2>&lt;slot&gt;</h2>

    <h2>&lt;sup&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>Subscript element</strong> specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely
        typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.</p>
    <h2>&lt;template&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>Content template (template) element</strong> is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered
        immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>&lt;textarea&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>textarea element</strong> represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to

        reminders.</p>
    <h2>&lt;u&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>str element</strong> represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates
        that

        experience.
    </p>
    <h2>&lt;wbr&gt;</h2>
    <p><strong>wbr element</strong> represents a word break opportunityâa position within text where the browser may
        optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.</p>
