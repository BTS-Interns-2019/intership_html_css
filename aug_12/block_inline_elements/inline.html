    <hr>

    <p><strong>Description: </strong>renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate.

    <h2>span</h2>
    <p><strong>Description: </strong>is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.
