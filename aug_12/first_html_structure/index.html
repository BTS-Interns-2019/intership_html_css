      <p>This is my first HTML in this Intern. My name is <em>Erick Israel</em>. I am 27 years old and i love to listen <strong>music</strong>,<br/>
        read, write, run, code. I studied music since i was 14yo, but couldn't treat something like music as an industry<br/> 
        thing, so i did embraced an old always wanted subject that is programing. There are many programers in my<br/> 
        family, so i'm just a <em>liiiiiiitle bit</em>
        familiarisized with it.... juuust a <strong>liiiiiiitle</strong>. Thanks.
      </p>

      <em>I'm not quietly sure what to write up next, but i just need to type something and use some <strong>STRONG</strong> tags 
      so i can accomplish my exercise</em>.

      <hr/>

      <p>Also, outside "em" tags we can type common <strong>STRONG</strong> tags, that are not like cursive thing.</p>

      <p>I wan play sometimes with<br/>
        Some<br/>
        Weird<br/>
        Things!!.... <br/> 
        <em>Not very practical, but funny!! Good day!</em></p>

      <h2>Have a great damn day!! Smile more!!</h2>
