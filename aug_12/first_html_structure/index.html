  <h1>This is me</h1>
  <h2>Who I am</h2>

  <p>
    My name is Héctor Soto García. Born and raised in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua and I studied <em>Software Engineering</em> at the <strong>Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez (UACJ)</strong>. I came to this internship with the purpose of strenghtening my software developing skills and mature in my career, as well as in my own life.

  <p>
    So far, <strong>Blue Trail Sofwtare</strong> has done an excellent job at giving me a good run for my money and handing me hard humbleness lessons. And I expect them to keep it that way.

  <h2>What I like to do</h2>
  <p>
    My hobbies are listed below: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reading about practically <em>anything</em>. I love reading fiction like fantasy, sci-fi, romance, historical fiction and other genres. But I am also delighted by non-fiction books that can range from History, Science, Psychology, Biographies. I can and will read about anything.
    </li>
    <li>
      I also started writing a few months ago. It is a new hobby I wanted to develop and that it has helped me express my ideas, emotions and some strange prompts people on the Internet come up with. So far I am only writing short stories, and the current one is about a person meeting the parents about his SO, but the parents are demigods and are trying everything they can to not seem so awkardly out of time and give up their true identities.
    </li>
    <li>
      It's been a long time since I played a videogame, but I still like to do it from time to time. Instead, I prefer to watch people play on platforms like <strong>Twitch</strong> or watch tournaments like the <strong>EVO</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I like to learn a <em>lot</em>. It is one of the few things I try to dive myself into everyday if possible. This goes along with reading because some of the books I read have the purpose of teaching me something. So I can mix two hobbies at the same time.
    </li>

      Other things like practicing sports sporadically, train boxing, dancing, cooking, etc.
