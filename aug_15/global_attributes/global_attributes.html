<h1>Global attributes</h1>
<p><strong>Global attributes</strong> are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can be used on all elements,
    though they may have no effect on some elements.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>acceskey</dt>
    <dd>provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current element. The attribute value must consist of
        a single printable character (which includes accented and other characters that can be generated by the
        keyboard).
    </dd>
    <dt>autocapitalize</dt>
    <dd>This attribute is an enumerated attribute that controls whether and how text input is automatically capitalized
        as it is entered/edited by the user. The attribute must take one of the following values:
        <ul>
            <li><code>off</code> or <code>none</code>: No autocapitalization is applied (all letters default to
                lowercase)
            </li>
            <li><code>on</code> or <code>sentences</code>: The first letter of each sentence defaults to a capital
                letter; all other letters default to lowercase
            </li>
            <li><code>words:</code> The first letter of each word defaults to a capital letter; all other letters
                default to lowercase
            </li>
            <li><code>characters</code>: All letters should default to uppercase</li>
        </ul>

    </dd>
    <dt>class</dt>
    <dd>A space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allows CSS and JavaScript to select and access
        specific elements via the class selectors or functions like the method
        <code>Document.getElementsByClassName()</code>.
    </dd>
    <dt>contenteditable</dt>
    <dd>The <code>
        <stron>contenteditable</stron>
    </code> is an enumerated attribute indicating if the element should be editable by the user. If so, the browser
        modifies its widget to allow editing. The attribute must take one of the following values:
        <ul>
            <li><code>true</code> or the empty string, which indicates that the element must be editable;</li>
            <li><code>false</code>, which indicates that the element must not be editable.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>*contextmenu</dt>
    <dd>is the id of a <code>&lt;menu&gt;</code> to use as the contextual menu for this element.</dd>
    <dt>data-*</dt>
    <dd>Forms a class of attributes, called custom data attributes, that allow proprietary information to be exchanged
        between the HTML and its DOM representation that may be used by scripts. All such custom data are available via
        the <code>HTMLElement</code> interface of the element the attribute is set on. The
        <code>HTMLElement.dataset</code> property gives access
        to them.
        dir
    </dd>
    <dt>dir</dt>
    <dd>
        An enumerated attribute indicating the directionality of the element's text. It can have the following values:An
        enumerated attribute indicating the directionality of the element's text. It can have the following values:
        <ul>
            <li><code>ltr</code>, which means left to right and is to be used for languages that are written from the
                left to the right (like English);
            </li>
            <li><code>rtl</code>, which means right to left and is to be used for languages that are written from the
                right to the left (like Arabic);
            </li>
            <li><code>auto</code> which lets the user agent decide. It uses a basic algorithm as it parses the
                characters inside the element until it finds a character with a strong directionality, then it applies
                that directionality to the whole element.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>draggable</dt>
    <dd>The draggable global attribute is an enumerated attribute that indicates whether the element can be dragged,
        either with native browser behavior or the HTML Drag and Drop API.
        <code>draggable</code> can have the following values:
        <ul>
            <li><code>true</code>: the element can be dragged.</li>
            <li><code>false</code>: the element cannot be dragged.</li>
        </ul>
        If this attribute is not set, its default value is auto, which means drag behavior is the default browser
        behavior: only text selections, images, and links can be dragged.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>dropzone (experimental technology)</strong></dt>
    <dd> global attribute is an enumerated attribute indicating what types of content can be dropped on an element,
        using the HTML Drag and Drop API. It can have the following values:
        <ul>
            <li><code>copy</code>, which indicates that dropping will create a copy of the element that was dragged.
            </li>
            <li><code>move</code>, which indicates that the element that was dragged will be moved to this new location.
            </li>
            <li><code>link</code>, which will create a link to the dragged data.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>hidden</strong></dt>
    <dd>A Boolean attribute indicates that the element is not yet, or is no longer, relevant. For example, it can be
        used to hide elements of the page that can't be used until the login process has been completed. The browser
        won't render such elements. This attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be shown.
        Similarly, a canvas element with the hidden attribute could be used by a scripted graphics engine as an
        off-screen buffer, and a form control could refer to a hidden form element using its form attribute.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>id</strong></dt>
    <dd>Defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the
        element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS). <code>id</code>'s value
        must not
        contain whitespace (spaces, tabs etc.).
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>inputmode</strong></dt>
    <dd>is an enumerated attribute that provides a hint as to the type of data that might be entered by the user while
        editing the element or its contents. It can have the following values:
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>none</strong></dt>
            <dd>No virtual keyboard; this is useful when the application or site implements its own keyboard input
                control.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>text</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Standard text input keyboard for the user's current locale.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>decimal</strong></dt>
            <dd>Fractional numeric input keyboard containing the digits and the appropriate separator character for the
                user's locale (typically either "." or ","). Devices may or may not show a minus key.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>numeric</strong></dt>
            <dd>Numeric input keyboard; all that is needed are the digits 0 through 9. Devices may or may not show a
                minus key.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>tel</strong></dt>
            <dd>A telephone keypad input, including the digits 0 through 9, the asterisk ("*"), and the pound ("#") key.
                Form inputs that require a telephone keypad should typically use <code>&lt;input type="tel"&gt;</code>
                instead.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>search</strong></dt>
            <dd>A virtual keyboard optimized for search input. For instance, the return key may be re-labeled "Search",
                and there may be other optimizations.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>email</strong></dt>
            <dd>A virtual keyboard optimized for entering email addresses; typically this includes the "@" character as
                well as other optimizations. Form inputs that require email address entry should typically use &lt;input
                type="email"&gt; instead.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>url</strong></dt>
            <dd>A keypad optimized for entering URLs. This may have the "/" key more prominently available, for example.
                Enhanced features could include history access and the like as well. Form inputs that request a URL
                should typically use &lt;input type="url"&gt; instead.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>is</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Allows you to specify that a standard HTML element should behave like a registered custom built-in element (see
        Using custom elements for more details).
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>itemid</strong></dt>
    <dd>The unique, global identifier of an item.</dd>
    <dt><strong>itemprop</strong></dt>
    <dd>Used to add properties to an item. Every HTML element may have an <code>itemprop</code> attribute specified,
        where an <code>itemprop</code> consists of a name and value pair.
    </dd>
    <dt>itemref</dt>
    <dd>Properties that are not descendants of an element with the <code>itemscope</code> attribute can be associated
        with the item using an <code>itemref</code>. It provides a list of element ids (not <code>itemids</code>) with
        additional properties elsewhere in the document.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>itemscope</strong></dt>
    <dd><code>itemscope</code> (usually) works along with <code>itemtype</code> to specify that the HTML contained in a
        block is about a
        particular item. <code>itemscope</code> creates the Item and defines the scope of the <code>itemtype</code>
        associated with it. <code>itemtype</code>
        is a valid URL of a vocabulary (such as schema.org) that describes the item and its properties context.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>itemtype</strong></dt>
    <dd>Specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define itemprops (item properties) in the data
        structure. itemscope is used to set the scope of where in the data structure the vocabulary set by itemtype will
        be active.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>itemlang</strong></dt>
    <dd>Helps define the language of an element: the language that non-editable elements are in, or the language that
        editable elements should be written in by the user.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>slot</strong></dt>
    <dd>Assigns a slot in a shadow DOM shadow tree to an element: An element with a slot attribute is assigned to the
        slot created by the
        <code>slot</code> element whose name attribute's value matches that slot attribute's value
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>spellcheck</strong></dt>
    <dd>An enumerated attribute defines whether the element may be checked for spelling errors. It may have the
        following values:
        <ul>
            <li>true, which indicates that the element should be, if possible, checked for spelling errors;</li>
            <li>false, which indicates that the element should not be checked for spelling errors</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>style</strong></dt>
    <dd>Contains CSS styling declarations to be applied to the element. Note that it is recommended for styles to be
        defined in a separate file or files. This attribute and the &lt;style&gt; element have mainly the purpose of
        allowing for quick styling, for example for testing purposes.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>tabindex</strong></dt>
    <dd>An integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to
        sequential keyboard navigation, and if so, at what position. It can take several values:
        <ul>
            <li>a negative value means that the element should be focusable, but should not be reachable via sequential
                keyboard navigation;
            </li>
            <li>0 means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, but its
                relative order is defined by the platform convention;
            </li>
            <li>a positive value means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard
                navigation; the order in which the elements are focused is the increasing value of the tabindex. If
                several elements share the same tabindex, their relative order follows their relative positions in the
                document.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>title</strong></dt>
    <dd>Contains a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can
        typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong>translate</strong></dt>
    <dd>An enumerated attribute that is used to specify whether an element's attribute values and the values of its Text
        node children are to be translated when the page is localized, or whether to leave them unchanged. It can have
        the following values:
        <ul>
            <li>empty string and yes, which indicates that the element will be translated.
            </li>
            <li>no, which indicates that the element will not be translated.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd></dd>
