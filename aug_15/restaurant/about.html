        <h2>Our whereabouts?</h2>

        <p>
          Well, that's a tricky question. We can only say that the Mossdrop Inn is not a place to be found. It finds you. But if we want to narrow it down, head over to the <i>Gracerich Woods</i> on the western side of the city of Phadarel. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Be sure to come with an empty stomach and a craving for deliciousness!</strong> The Mossdrop Inn knows when it is time to show up to a hungry wanderer. So walk a bit around the forest, and when you see a golden gleam and can smell the burning logs of oaks, know that you are here.

        <h2>What do we do, exactly?</h2>

        <p>
          In a few words, we create culinary masterpieces that seem to be magical <small>(and some of them are...)</small>. Detailing a bit more, we take our cooking as a craft that we embrace with passion, love and huge quantities of sweat and blood. But not over your food, don't worry. We make sure that the taste of the food you eat and the beverage you drink are recorded in fire deep in your heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          We pride ourselves in being the only restaurant in the region that has had the honor of having customers ranging from the humblest of commoners, passing by powerful adventurers, up to the magnificient rulers of the continent. Our plates have been in front of every race imaginable. Humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, dark elves, orcs, tieflings; all welcomed! Everyone at our tables get served equally. No distinctions. Food doesn't know when to taste better or worse depending on the person, so we don't do it either.
        </p>
