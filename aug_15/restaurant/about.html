          <h2>Our whereabouts?</h2>

          <p>
            Well, that's a tricky question. We can only say that the Mossdrop Inn is not a place to be found. It founds you. But if we want to narrow it down, head over to the <i>Gracerich Woods</i> on the western side of the city of Phadarel. 
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Be sure to come with an empty stomach and a craving for deliciousness!</strong> The Mossdrop Inn knows when it is time to show up to a hungry wanderer. So walk a bit around the forest, and when you see a golden gleam and can smell the burning logs of oaks, know that you are here.
