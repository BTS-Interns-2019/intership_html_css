        <p>
          Located at the depths of the <i>Gracerich Woods</i>, the <strong>Mossdrop Inn</strong> appears in the middle of an unexpected glade covered by golden grass and the warming smell of wood in the fireplace. Its big wooden doors always open to receive fearless adventurers and hardworking commoners alike. Here, you can find food and drinks that promise to replenish your energy, fill your stomach and draw a satisfied grin on your face.
