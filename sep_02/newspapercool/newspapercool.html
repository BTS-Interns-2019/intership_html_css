            Are instructions that difficult?
          </h3>

            According to different sources, interns studying at the current program hosted and delivered by Blue Trail Software are having serious difficulties in following any set of instructions either for a test or an exercise. Several are failing a number of the exercises handed by the instructors only because there seems to be problems of misunderstanding or that the interns are plainly skipping the instructions and do them solely based on assumptions. These has led the instructors of the internship to take the matter into their own hands and give out a kind of a test which only purpose was to determine whether the interns actually read what is put in front of them or they dive in head first to try and "solve" the problem. 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            The test revealed that most of the interns have the bad habit of starting to work on anything without understanding the true specifications for it. While the instructors have declared that being enthusiastic about working for a solution and being passionate about wanting to do more, they also think that this passion, this misguided energy, is having repercussions with the interns scores because appareantly, none of them can read instructions whatsoever. Everyone of them has demonstrated at least a small degree of this problem. The instructors fear that this way of doing things can (and will) have consequences on the long term, specially when working on real-world projects.

          <p>
            To address this issue, the instructors have decided it is time to come up personally in front of the interns and tell them to step up their "following instructions" game, and for the love of God, READ THE DAMNED INSTRUCTIONS. This last part was not said by the intructors, but it is the personal opinion of the author that it should have been said. Even the author has suffered from it sometimes, so a wake up call is more than welcome.

            Nothing like a <em>carne asada</em> to bring people together

            On last week's friday, the monthly Blue Trail Software <em>carne asada</em> took place and this time it was special in a certain way. People from different parts of the world were present at this traditional event and enjoyed the delicious steak cuts and drinks that were served there. <small><em>All paid by the company's wallet because they love us so much, the author dares to say.</em></small>

            It was a real success and everyone had a great time. A Blue Trail Software's member stationed in Argentina declared that not only the environment that the company creates among its workers is something remarkable, but also that he is more than pleased with how he was treated in his first time in Mexico. He even shared some of his liquor straight from Argentina.

            Even the company's co-founder, Remy, graced everyone with his presence. A Paris-born charismatic and interesting man that would normally be treated with utter caution by his workers sharing a meal with them shows true humbleness. He even took the time to converse with the author and give some of the meat in his plate to one of the office's dog, Petra. One could really tell he was having fun with everyone else.
