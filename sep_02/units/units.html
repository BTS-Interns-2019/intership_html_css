<h1>CSS units</h1>
<p>
  The numeric type you will come across most frequently is
  <code>&lt;length&gt;</code>, for example 10px (pixels) or 30em. There are two
  types of lengths used in CSS â€” relative and absolute. It's important to know
  the difference in order to understand how big things will become.
</p>
<p>
  In summary, absolute means that the size of the element or the text will
  always be the same, no matter what happen
</p>
<h2>Absolute length units</h2>
<table border="" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <th>Unit</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Equivalent to</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>cm</td>
      <td>Centimeters</td>
      <td>1cm = 96px/2.54</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>mm</td>
      <td>Milimeters</td>
      <td>1mm = 1/10th of 1cm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Q</td>
      <td>Quarter-millimeters</td>
      <td>1Q = 1/40th of 1cm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>in</td>
      <td>Inches</td>
      <td>1in = 2.54cm = 96px</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pc</td>
      <td>Picas</td>
      <td>1pc = 1/16th of 1in</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pt</td>
      <td>Points</td>
      <td>1pt = 1/72th of 1in</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>px</td>
      <td>Pixels</td>
      <td>1px = 1/96th of 1in</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  Most of these values are useful for print, but not for screen sizes, for that
  we usaully use units like px
</p>
<h2>Relative length units</h2>
<p>
  Relative lengths units are "relative" to something else, for example the size
  of the parent element, or the viewport. One benenfit of use this types of
  units is tha you can rezise yoru text or other elements scale with the rest of
  the page.
</p>
<p>
  Opposite of absolute, relative units are "rezisable", this means that element
  will change with the rest of the window or the page. Relative are scalable,
  this make them more usefull at the time to work in screens that has differents
  sizes
</p>
<table border="" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <th>Unit</th>
    <th>Relative to to</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>em</td>
      <td>Font size of the parent element.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ex</td>
      <td>x-height of the element's font.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>rem</td>
      <td>Font size of the root element.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>lh</td>
      <td>Line height of the element.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>vw</td>
      <td>1% of the viewport's width.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>vh</td>
      <td>1% of the viewport's height.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>vmin</td>
      <td>1% of the viewport's smaller dimension.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>vmax</td>
      <td>1% of the viewport's larger dimension.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>percentage</td>
      <td>A percentage relative to the parent</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h3><code>em</code> and <code>rem</code></h3>
<p>
  em and rem are the two relative lengths you are likely to encounter most
  frequently when sizing anything from boxes to text.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>em</code></dt>
  <dd>
    A relative measurement for the height of a font in <code>em</code> spaces.
    Because an em unit is equivalent to the size of a given font, if you assign
    a font to 12pt, each "em" unit would be 12pt; thus, 2em would be 24pt.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>rem</code></dt>
  <dd>
    rem is similar to em, but instead of varying on the current element font
    size, it uses the root element (html) font size. You set that font size
    once, and rem will be a consistent measure across all the page.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Percentage</h3>
<p>
  In a lot of cases a percentage is treated in the same way as a length. The
  thing with percentages is that they are always set relative to some other
  value. For example, if you set an element's font-size as a percentage it will
  be a percentage of the font-size of the element's parent. If you use a
  percentage for a width value, it will be a percentage of the width of the
  parent.
</p>

<h3>viewport units</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>vw</dt>
  <dd>
    the viewport width unit represents a percentage of the viewport width. 50vw
    means 50% of the viewport width.
  </dd>
  <dt>vh</dt>
  <dd>
    the viewport height unit represents a percentage of the viewport height.
    50vh means 50% of the viewport height.
  </dd>
  <dt>vmin</dt>
  <dd>
    the viewport minimum unit represents the minimum between the height or width
    in terms of percentage. 30vmin is the 30% of the current width or height,
    depending which one is smaller
  </dd>
  <dt>vmax</dt>
  <dd>
    the viewport maximum unit represents the maximum between the height or width
    in terms of percentage. 30vmax is the 30% of the current width or height,
    depending which one is bigger
  </dd>
</dl>
