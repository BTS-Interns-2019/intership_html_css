                Being spaces where so much stress is accumulated by the workload, several companies have opted to 
                allow workers to take their pets to promote a better working environment. From this we have the 
                beautiful example of Petra, since his presence in the office helps interns too much, releasing stress, 
                improving productivity, encouraging creativity, encouraging dialogue and connection between colleagues, 
                since Petra attracts reflectors and It is inevitable to give him all the love.</p></div>
